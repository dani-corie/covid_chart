# covid_chart

A quick Jupyter visualization of covid data from a JSON API (currently using the JSON feed of Morgenpost.de). Filterable by region (German Bundesl√§nder or country codes for international).

Daily indicators are visualized as 7 day moving averages to filter out 7 day periodic noise in the data series.
